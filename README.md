### Background
We mobile coders were coding with Spck Editor alongwith Termux, and to make it more convenient to run codes from spck to termux, we used [rovelstars/spck-termux](https://github.com/rovelstars/spck-termux) to run codes from spck to termux. But, time passed by and we got new Android phones (and with newer Android versions), `spck-termux` stopped working due to newer Android version's security policies. So, I decided to make a new app to run codes from spck to termux, and that's how Smux was born!
